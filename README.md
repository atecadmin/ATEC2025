# Online Competition – Track 2: Hardware Track 
The Online Competition (Hardware Track) is designed to evaluate the locomotion and object manipulation capabilities of robot systems in unstructured terrains and environments. Teams must design and validate a system that integrates a legged robot with a robotic arm. While teams have the flexibility to choose their legged robot platform, they must independently design and construct the robotic arm, grasping system, and perception system.   
The robot must demonstrate stable locomotion, adaptability to complex terrains, and precise object grasping and transportation in a simulated environment. Teams must submit a detailed design proposal, covering motion control algorithms, robotic arm structure, system integration interfaces, and safety and protection mechanisms. A simulation test is required to validate system stability, grasp accuracy, and impact resistance. Designs must consider weight distribution, dynamic loads, and vibrations of the robotic arm and mobile platform to ensure efficient performance in complex tasks.

# Offline Competition:  Real-World Extreme Challenge
The Offline Competition is related to the Online Competition but focuses on the comprehensive application of various skills and problem-solving abilities. Teams are required to tackle challenges based on the application scenarios provided during the competition.The Organizing Committee will release a list of required hardware equipment. Contestants may select and modify their equipment within the bounds of competition rules. Contestants are also encouraged to develop their own equipment.  
# Qualification Rules
After the Online Competition ends, the top 10 teams from each track will be invited to the Offline Competition, where they will form combined teams. Each combined team will consist of one Hardware Track team and one Software Track team.  
Teams that register for both tracks and place in the top 10 for each track may choose one of the following options:  
1) Compete independently, occupying one qualification spot in each of the two tracks for entry to the Offline Competition.  
2) Join a combined team. If the rankings for the two tracks differ, the team will form a combined team under the track with the higher ranking by default. If the rankings for both tracks are the same, the team may select its preferred track to form a combined team within the time limit specified by the competition rules.  
Additional Notes:  
If a top-10 team declines to form a combined team, the next highest-ranked team will be invited to take its place. If a team withdraws from a combined team, the remaining team may select a new partner according to the above rules to participate in the Offline Competition.  
  
As this is the first time the Competition is open to global participants, and to attract more outstanding teams, the Organizing Committee will invite teams, nominated by the Chair of the Jury Committee and selected through a vote based on competition rules, to participate in the Offline Competition. Up to five teams may be invited, with a maximum of eight members per team. These teams do not participate in the Online Competition. Instead, they advance directly to the Offline Competition and are not required to form combined teams.  
  
Before the preparation period begins, the Organizing Committee will release a list of required hardware equipment. Contestants may select and customize their equipment in accordance with the competition rules. Contestants are also encouraged to develop their own innovative robotic systems for the Competition, with appropriate allowances provided. Further details on the equipment list and allowance usage will be available on the official ATEC website.  
# Evaluation Scopes
The offline competition will require each participating team to use their own robot system to complete the following 4 tasks in an outdoor environment:  
1. Object Sorting Task:  
The robot needs to identify, pick up, transport, and classify specific types of items within a designated area. The system should be equipped with visual perception, precise manipulation, and classification decision-making capabilities.  
2. Object Transport and Water Sprinkling Task:  
The robot needs to locate target items within a designated area, to plan operation sequences for sprinklers, faucets and other equipment, and to achieve object transport and fixed-point operation tasks. The system shall integrate environmental perception, motion planning, precise control and other functional modules.  
3. Field Endurance Task:  
The robot needs to maintain stable movement across outdoor terrain, including arched bridges, stairs, and gentle slopes. The system should be equipped with multi-sensor data fusion and adaptive motion control capabilities.  
4. Suspension Bridge Crossing Task:  
The robot needs to navigate through unevenly-spaced suspension bridges, laying wooden planks autonomously to ensure successful crossing (if necessary). The system should be equipped with stable motion planning, visual perception, precise operation, and rapid transit capabilities.  
# Hardware Support
The offline competition will provide participating teams with commercial-grade hardware supplies. Teams may choose independent research and development or configure their systems through the certified list provided by the Organizing Committee. Hardware specifications and configuration guidelines are scheduled for release in May 2025.
